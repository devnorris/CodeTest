# Mimicry

Working with Lyrebirds Custom Voice API, Mimicry gives you the power to take a digital voice from one of the cloned voices provided and generate text, enabling you to create custom utterances. After an utterance is created, you have the ability to download the utterance and use it where ever you'd like.

## Getting Started

1. Recieve an unique API key from Lyrebird and store in away in an environment variable.
2. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
3. cd into reactbird directory and run `npm install`, to *install react dependencies*.
4. `npm start` to start the server.
5. **Visit http://localhost:3000/**

## More To Come

1. Display status of generated audio asynchronously.
2. Preview and download Utterances.
