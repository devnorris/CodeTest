# Mimicry

Working with Lyrebirds Custom Voice API, Mimicry gives you the power to take a digital voice from one of the cloned voices provided and generate text, enabling you to create custom utterances. After an utterance is created, you have the ability to download the utterance and use it where ever you'd like.
